      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose of creating this website is to display articles of clothing that will be sold therein, contact information, and general information about the creator and their products. The main page will be used to create interest in the products and the two other child elements will allow viewers to learn more about the products and contact the provider to buy said products.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be whoever is interested in purchasing dresses, shirts, and other articles of clothing. This may be college students looking for customized products, high school students for prom dresses, or just natural adjustments to articles of clothing. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
       The header will be small with the logo and the navigation links to give customers the greater focus on a couple items in three proction sections that we produce. 
       This home webpage's goal for my personal website will immediately be to immediately introduce customers to the sewing products and services that we provide and then 
       give further information about the company as they desire. 
        Further down the page will show the creator of the products, some context on who they are, and their interests. Next will be our business's vision
        and goals in providing quality services and products to every customer we come in contact with. 
        Finally, the footer will have a link to the ContactUs page and links to each respective social media account.

      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        This link from the home page will direct customers to the products and services we provide with full inventory in three sections:
        clothing, Fabrics, and adjustments. With boxes that display each respective product and their estimated price, this will give customers visual
        ease in seeing which products we provide, how much it would cost for specific materials, and some examples of adjustments that the seamstress can do.
        This will also make it easier to make adjustments to the index code when it comes to updating products on the page. I hope to eventually add a search bar
        feature that will filter out specific products that a customer is looking for and make other options that don't apply to those filters to disappear. 
        There will be boxes in sets of 4 divided evenly throughtout the screen. This will give plenty of room between each product and price to then allow customers
        to see what is available. As they scroll down they see more selections of the particular category until that section runs out of products. In order the products
        will be clothing, fabrics, and then adjustments. This will allow customers to see all options on a singular page. I also hope to add a link at the top and bottom
        of the page to easily navigate between sections.

      <h3>Contact Information</h3>
      <p>
        Page three will consist of the busiesses information like: email, phone number, social media outlets, etc. Until I am able to learn how to make 
        submittal forms on the customers in which they can fill out and submit right then and there on the website, a simplified version of contact information
        will have to suffice. I hope to learn how to do that so that the seamstress and myself can see requests and order forms that customers have made right there
        on the website. Creating logins might be something to look into as well and how to do that securely. This page will, however, consist of several pictures 
        showing purchasing of clothing and eventually a picture of an actual product we've sold. The types of contact methods I would like to put on the page are 
        phone number, email, and social media accounts so if someone is interested and they want to see more content, they can do so on social media.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The Images below the subheadings of Clothing, Fabrics, and Adjustments will be corresponding pictures that match the subheading above them.
        These images will match products on the Products page and have a link to their respective section on that page. 
        link for the wireframe: https://wireframe.cc/5lfUk5

      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>         
        Each image will be it's own product with their respective price and description to the right of it. 
        This will give the consumer a look into what they might be purchasing, what it's made of, and time frame for it's creation.
