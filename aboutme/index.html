    <p>Hello Everyone! I graduated from Rigby, ID and am a transfer student from CSI after having graduating with my Associates Degree.
        Currently, I am working towards my Bachelor's Business Administration degree at BYU-I,my plummer's journeyman at CSI online, and working full-time in Jackson, WY (I'm just a little busy...).
        I was a baseball player all through High School and was trying out for CSI's baseball team until I re-injured my knee and my hip. 
        Fortunately, God's plan included meeting my wonderful wife in Twin Falls.
        We were married in the Twin Falls Temple this last April and moved to Rexburg towards the end of May. 
        I'm hoping to learn how to design my own website for any possible opportunities I might have in creating my own business in the future. 
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints my whole life and I went to Mendoza, Argentina & Tri-Cities, WA for my mission. 
        My favorite scripture has to be Ether 12:27. 

    </p>
